                    Lal Bahadur Shastri Training Institute is the first government registered institute set up in dehradun (uttrakhand) in the year 1996, which was inaugurated by hon'ble Mohd. Iftfarooqdeen (IAS) Vice chancellor MDDA. The details of other centres which were inaugurated by the personalities are Mr. Nityanand Swami (Sabhapati Vidhan Parishad UP). Mr.Harbans Kapoor (hon'ble Minister of rural development, UP). Mr Sanjay Garg (honorable minister of state for trade tax UP), Mr. Satya Narayan Srivastava, (city Magistrate, dehradun). Mr.Manoharma Sharma ( mayor dehradun). Mr. Surender Kumar Munni (MLA , Ghaziabad).Lal Bahadur Shastri Training Institute organized many Govt.training programs in association with UPCIO.

                    Lal Bahadur Shastri Training Institute is having a theme of providing quality education at dream cost.Lal Bahadur Shastri Training Institute aims at serving the people of the country by making them competent & strong enough to face the running life of the upcoming technologies. Our centres provide quality education in Computers, Fashion Designing, Beautician, Spoken English, Call Centre Training , N.T.T ( Nursery Teacher's Training ), NPTT ( Nursery and Primary Teacher's Training ). We have created a very friendly learning environment with the latest tools of educations.Number of candidates are sent by as to the corporations after the customized and individual training using our state-of-the-art training facilities.

                    We offer various Certificate/ Diploma courses in Computers, Fashion Designing and Beautician. We also provide various short term courses in computers, beauty culture etc. L.B.S.T.I. runs various study centres in India which is an affiliating and teaching centre which aims to facilitate and promote studies, research and extension of work in emerging areas of higher education with focus on professional education in the disciplines of computer hardware, software, networking, multimedia, fashion world, beauty culture, nursery teacher training, English conversation etc., also to achieve excellence in these and related fields and other matters connected there within or incidental there to.

                    Well-qualified, experienced certified instructors train the participants with easy-to-learn step by step training material in the most optimized period of time. Looking at the current demand of professional courses in the computer field, fashion world , beauty culture , nursery teaching; every second person wants to do one or the other diploma course. In schools, offices, banks, manufacturing concerns, export houses, call centers, advertising world, publishing houses and many more, everywhere they need employees who are computer literates. Some for their liking for computer, some for chatting with their children settled abroad and most of the people for their necessity.

                    But when a middle class group of people look at the high lump sum fees structure of the vocational study centres; half of them change their aim ; another manage however possible. We basically want to remove that horror from their minds as we are charging only the charges for the maintenance of our institute i. e. no tuition fees that too a very small amount, affordable by every segment of people. Thus by satisfying the needs of the people coming to us our purpose is successfully achieved.
